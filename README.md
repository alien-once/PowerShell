This file searches for keywords from a mounted image. The image file will have to be mounted using FTK imager. Insert keywords on line 17 in quotes.

Work in progress:
1. Ability to search on images that were mounted using Arsenal Image Mounter.
2. Ability to point to a text file or csv to use as search terms.
